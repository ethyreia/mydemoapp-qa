# MyDemoApp - Manual Quality Assurance Project

This repository contains the comprehensive manual quality assurance (QA) documentation for the **MyDemoApp** e-commerce platform. The project demonstrates a systematic approach to verifying core business features, ensuring functional accuracy, and maintaining a stable user experience.

## 📋 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to validate the critical user paths of an e-commerce environment. By analyzing complex workflows—from account creation to final checkout—I have provided a clear, actionable assessment of the application's current state.

### Key Testing Areas:
* **Account Authentication:** Login, registration, and session persistence.
* **Product Navigation:** Searching, filtering, and product detail accuracy.
* **Shopping Cart:** Adding/removing items and real-time total updates.
* **Checkout Process:** Address entry, payment simulation, and order confirmation.

## 🛠 Deliverables
The central component of this repository is the **Master Testing Workbook (Excel)**, which serves as the single source of truth for the QA lifecycle. It is organized into three main sections:

1.  **Test Plan:** Outlines the scope, strategy, environment details, and pass/fail criteria.
2.  **Test Case Suite:** A collection of step-by-step test cases including preconditions, input data, expected results, and actual results.
3.  **Defect Tracker:** A detailed log of all identified bugs, categorized by severity, priority, and status.

## 🚀 Execution Summary
During the testing phase, each scenario was evaluated for **functional accuracy** and **interface consistency**. 

* **Positive Testing:** Verified that the application performs as expected under normal conditions.
* **Negative Testing:** Validated the application's error-handling capabilities when faced with invalid inputs or unexpected user behavior.
* **UI/UX Assessment:** Checked for visual regressions, alignment issues, and overall usability.

The results documented in the workbook highlight specific areas where the actual behavior diverged from the expected requirements, providing a roadmap for software improvement.
